## Building a Comprehensive Photo-Viewing Application: A Journey with Multiple Storage Solutions

### Introduction

The idea of developing a photo-viewing application stems from the need to effectively manage and view a large collection of personal photographs and videos. One of the major factors influencing this project is the storage solution. Many of us rely on various cloud storage services to keep our digital content safe and accessible, and I am no exception. Given that different services come with unique advantages and limitations, my journey towards building this application has been influenced by the storage solutions I have at my disposal.

### Exploring Storage Solutions

Google, a widely recognized tech giant, provides approximately 15 gigabytes of cloud storage free of charge. This storage space is shared among various services, including Google Photos, Google Drive, and Google Mail. Though I do not use Google Mail, Google Docs, and Google Sheets as my primary tools for email and document management, I still leverage Google's storage due to my use of an Android phone. Consequently, my backups, photos, and other data share this 15 gigabytes of space. Considering the volume of data I accumulate over time, I have contemplated upgrading my Google storage. However, since I already subscribe to Microsoft Office, which includes a whopping one terabyte of cloud storage, I am hesitant to invest in an additional storage service when I already possess a substantial amount of space.

### Limitations and Alternatives

Despite the generous storage capacity provided by Microsoft Office, there is a significant limitation: its storage service cannot be accessed programmatically, at least not within the scope of my current understanding and expertise. This limitation presents a challenge for someone like me, who is looking to automate and streamline the management of their digital content. Given this constraint, I decided to explore alternative storage solutions that could cater to my specific needs more effectively.

### Choosing Amazon S3

After considering various options, I opted for Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) as the ideal solution for storing my older photographs and videos. Amazon S3 operates on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning I only pay for the storage space I actually use. This flexible and cost-effective approach aligns well with my requirements, as I can scale the storage capacity based on the volume of data without incurring unnecessary expenses. Storing my aged photos and videos in Amazon S3 offers me the convenience of reliable and secure cloud storage, along with the ability to access and manage my content programmatically.

### Developing the Photo-Viewing Application

With the storage solution in place, the next step is to develop the photo-viewing application itself. This application is primarily designed to serve as a front-end interface for viewing my photos stored in Amazon S3. However, its functionality extends beyond mere photo viewing. The application comprises two integral components: the indexing and thumbnail generation module, and the front-end user interface.

### Indexing and Thumbnail Generation

The first component of the application involves indexing and generating thumbnail images for the photographs and videos stored in Amazon S3. This process is essential for efficient navigation and quick access to the content. The indexing module will scan the storage, cataloging each file based on metadata such as date, location, and file type. Concurrently, the thumbnail generation module will create smaller, low-resolution versions of the images, which will be used for preview purposes within the application. This approach ensures that users can browse through their collection swiftly without having to load the full-sized images each time.

### Front-End User Interface

The second component is the front-end user interface, which serves as the primary interaction point for viewing and managing the photos. As the sole viewer, I intend to design this interface to be intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. To achieve this, I will leverage .NET technology, specifically using Blazor and Radzen for the development of the front-end. Blazor allows for the creation of interactive web UIs using C#, while Radzen provides a set of pre-built components that can enhance the overall design and functionality of the application.

### Integrating the Components

The seamless integration of the indexing and thumbnail generation module with the front-end user interface is crucial for the application's success. The back-end processes, including indexing and thumbnail creation, will run periodically to ensure that any new photos or videos added to Amazon S3 are promptly cataloged and made available for viewing. The front-end interface will fetch the necessary data from the back-end, presenting it in a visually appealing and organized manner.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the journey of building this photo-viewing application is driven by the need for an efficient and user-friendly solution to manage and view a large collection of digital photographs and videos.
